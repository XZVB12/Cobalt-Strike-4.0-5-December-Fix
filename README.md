# Cobalt-Strike-4.0-5-December-Fix

#### Fixed:
* Generation x64 Beacon Issue
* Notification Issues

#### Installation:
* Replace .class files inside cobalt strike with those in the repository.
* The .class files in this repository are compiled for java 13, if you are using a different version of java recompile the files using the source code.

#### Compilation:
* Place the .java files next to the cobaltstrike .jar file and run the javac -classpath cobaltstrike.jar name.java command.

Everything should work without problems, if you have errors let me know.  
All the best
